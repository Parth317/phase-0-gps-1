#Govind's Reflection

## What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I wanted to know how people tested another's pull request on their own computer.
## What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The guide clarified the reasoning for using present tense in commit messages, for being explicit with git push command, and testing another person's pull request.
## What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked the guide questions regarding the answer in #1.
## What still confuses you about Git?
I would like to learn how to roll back commits, see a real example of two or three individuals working together on different branches as well as sub branches of branches. I believe that will truly make me confident regarding Git.
## How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was similar to the two pairing sessions I had earlier this week. It was nice to have the guide to be able to jump in and clarify whenever necessary.
